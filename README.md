# Research_Project_code
This code was used to extract coordinates from CSV files and compute motions metrics on them. To run this code change the path directory to include your CSV file path directory. Main scripts to run for proof-of-concept experiment are "experiment_angle_length" and "experiment_path_length.py". Main scripts to run for clinical data experiment are "final_code_pathlength.py" and "final_code_angle_length.py", main script for moving average is "moving_average_angle_length.py", and for path length moving average follow instruction in "final_code_pathlength.py" brief at the beginning of the code. Sample statistics to calculate p-values using Man-Whitney-U test is provided in "test.py"
